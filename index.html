        <h3>Artisan Pies</h3>

Our <span>POP PIE</span> chefs are artistic artisans – but instead of paints and canvas, they have dough and an infinate combination of flavourful fillings guaranteed to make your mouth water!</p>

        <h3>Word on the Street</h3>
        
        <p> Here's some of the things celebrities have been saying about <span>POP PIE</span>?</p>
            
        <blockquote>
            <p>POP PIE changed my life! I regularly have my favourite pies delivered to me on set.<span>– Ryan Gosling</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>I don't know how I lived before POP PIE. I visit Ottawa as often as possible just for the pies.<span>– Barack Obama</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>POP PIES make me feel bright… like a diamond<span>– Rihanna</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <h4>We Believe …</h4>

        
        <p>We believe that our pies at <span>POP PIE</span> are a metaphor for life; while many pies might look the same on the outside, you can't tell the true quality of a pie until you take that first bite…</p>
        
        <h3>POP PIE Philosophy</h3>
        
        <p>In life, and with pies, sometimes you have to take a laep of faith: accept that new job, try that hollywood hairdo, sample the new pie baked with corn and bacon and maple syrup! Life is about adventure, and so are <span>POP PIES</span>! So take a chance and try something new today!</p>
